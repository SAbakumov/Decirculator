# Repository accompanying the Circulator paper. 

## How to run
There are two ways to explore this repository: either through Google Colab, or by cloning the repository locally. The Google
Colab environment is highly interactive and we encourage the users to first explore the methods proposed in our work through 
the interactive notebooks provided.

### Colab
To use Colab, you need a gmail account, and the only thing you have to do is to go to:

- https://colab.research.google.com/github/SAbakumov/Decirculator

There you can select out of 2 available notebooks:

- decirculator_smlm.ipynb -> This is the notebook focussing on the neural network application to PSF reconstruction. There, you can
run the CNN and compare the obtained reconstructed images
- origami_tracking.ipynb -> This is the notebook about the origami tracking analysis. In there, all the analysis regarding tracking,
MSD and diffusion coefficient calculation can be found and reproduced. 

### Locally
(under construction)
